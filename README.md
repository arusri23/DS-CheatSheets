### This is a repository of all the datascience cheatsheets, which I have. I keep updating this folder and use it for my quick reference.

Kept at dropbox
> \02-Cloud\Dropbox\Cheat-Sheets

and github
> \github\4-Tech-Courses\DS-CheatSheets

for sharing and easy axis purpose. Bigfiles are not supported or have issue in github.

Sometimes it is easy to share via Dropbox.
